# AppDynamics Ansible Collection

The AppDynamics Ansible Collection installs and configures AppDynamics agents and configurations. All supported agents are downloaded from the download portal unto the Ansible control node automatically –– this makes it easy to acquire and upgrade agents declaratively.

Refer to the [role variables](#Role-Variables) below for a description of available deployment options.

We built this AppDynamics Ansible collection to support (immutable) infrastructure as code deployment methodology; this means that the collection will NOT preserve any manual configuration changes on the target servers. In other words, the collection will overwrite any local or pre-existing configuration with the variables that are defined in the playbook.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you convert any custom agent configuration (this collection does not support) into an ansible role to ensure consistency of deployments and configurations across your estate.

## Requirements

- Requires Ansible >=2.8.0
- Supports most Debian and RHEL-based Linux distributions, and Windows.
- Windows OS requires >= Powershell 5.0
- Network/firewall access to download AppDynamics agents from `https://download-files.appdynamics.com` and `https://download.appdynamics.com` on the Ansible control node  
 -  <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"> `jq` </a> is required on the Ansible control node. It is recommended that you install it manually (since it requires `sudo` access and it is a one time task), or run the `install_jq.yaml` playbook in the `playbook` folder. For example: `ansible-playbook install_jq.yaml --ask-become-pass -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python'`
 - `lxml` is required if you need to enable enhanced agent logging (e.g DEBUG, TRACE, etc). We recommend that you install it manaually on the Ansible control node using `pip3 install lxml`, or run the `install_lxml.yaml` playbook in the `playbook` folder.

## Supported Agents

The agent binaries and the installation process for the Machine and DB agent depend on the OS type –– Windows or Linux. This AppDynamics collection abstracts the OS differences so you should only have to provide `agent_type`, without necessarily specifying your OS type.  

| Agent type <img width="180"/> | Description |
|--|--|
|`sun-java`   or     `java`   | Agent to monitor Java applications running on JRE version 1.7 and less |
|`sun-java8`   or     `java8`   | Agent to monitor Java applications running on JRE version 1.8 and above |
|`ibm-java` | Agent to monitor Java applications running on IBM JRE |
|`dotnet` | Agent to monitor Full .Net Framework application on Windows |
|`machine` | 64 Bit Machine agent ZIP bundle with JRE. Windows and Linux |
|`db` | Agent to monitor Databases. Windows and Linux|
|`dotnetcore` | Agent to Monitor .NetCore applications on Linux|
## Installation

Install the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/appdynamics"> AppDynamics Collection </a> from Ansible Galaxy on your Ansible control node:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install appdynamics.agents
```

## Playbooks
Example playbooks for each agent type is provided in the collections's `playbooks` folder.  
You should either reference the example playbooks in the collection installation folder, or access the examples in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-ansible/tree/master/playbooks"> repository </a>.

The `var/playbooks/controller.yaml` file is meant to contain constant variables such as `enable_ssl`, `controller_port`, etc. You may either include `var/playbooks/controller.yaml` in the playbook as shown in the java example below, or overwrite the variables in the playbooks - whatever works best for you.

## Java agent

```yml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Include variables for the controller settings
      include_vars: vars/controller.yaml
    - include_role:
        name: appdynamics.agents.java
      vars:
        agent_version: 20.10.0
        agent_type: java8
        application_name: "IoT_API" # ONLY required if agent type is not machine or db
        tier_name: "java_tier" # ONLY required if agent type is not machine or db
        # Directory permissions for agent. These can be set at host level in the invertory as well
        agent_dir_permission:  #defaults to root:root if not specified
          user:  "appdynamics" # This user must pre-exist. It is recommended to use the PID owner of your Java app
          group: "appdynamics" # This group must pre-exist
```

### DotNet agent

In the playbook below, the parameters are initialised directly in the yaml file rather than including them from `var/playbooks/controller.yaml`

```yml
---
- hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: appdynamics.agents.dotnet
      vars:
        agent_version: 20.8.0
        agent_type: dotnet
        application_name: 'IoT_API'
        # Your controller details
        controller_account_access_key: "123456" # Please add this to your Vault
        controller_global_analytics_account_name: "customer1_GUID" # Please add this to your Vault
        controller_host_name: "fieldlab.saas.appdynamics.com"
        controller_account_name: "customer1" # Please add this to your Vault
        enable_ssl: "true"
        controller_port: "443"
        enable_proxy: "true"  #use quotes please
        proxy_host: "10.0.1.3"
        proxy_port: "80"
        monitor_all_IIS_apps: "false"  # Enable automatic instrumentation of all IIS applications
        runtime_reinstrumentation: "true" # Runtime reinstrumentation works for .NET Framework 4.5.2 and greater.
        # Define standalone executive applications to monitor
        standalone_applications:
          - tier: login
            executable: login.exe
          - tier: tmw
            executable: tmw.exe
            command-line: "-x"
          - tier: mso
            executable: mso.exe
```

### Machine agent

```yml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: appdynamics.agents.machine
      vars:
        # Define Agent Type and Version
        agent_version: 20.9.0
        agent_type: machine
        machine_hierarchy: "AppName|Owners|Environment|" # Make sure it ends with a |
        sim_enabled: "true"
        # Analytics settings
        analytics_event_endpoint: "https://fra-ana-api.saas.appdynamics.com:443"
        enable_analytics_agent: "true"
        # Your controller details
        controller_account_access_key: "123key" # Please add this to your Vault
        controller_host_name: "fieldlab.saas.appdynamics.com" # Your AppDynamics controller
        controller_account_name: "customer1" # Please add this to your Vault
        enable_ssl: "false"
        controller_port: "8090"
        controller_global_analytics_account_name: 'customer1_e52eb4e7-25d2-41c4-a5bc-9685502317f2' # Please add this to your Vault
        # config properties docs - https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/latest/Machine+Agent+Configuration+Properties
        # Can be used to configure the proxy for the agent
        java_system_properties: "-Dappdynamics.http.proxyHost=10.0.4.2 -Dappdynamics.http.proxyPort=9090" # mind the space between each property
```
### Logger
The logger role allows you to change the agent log level for already deployed agents (either one agent type at a time or multiple types, depending on the value of the `agents_to_set_loggers_for` list.

The `init_and_validate_agent_variables` should be  **false** when using the logger role after the agents are already deployed, to skip unnecessary common role processing.

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
      - include_role:
          name: appdynamics.agents.logger
        vars:
          init_and_validate_agent_variables: false # skip agent type variable init and validation
          agents_to_set_loggers_for: ['db', 'java', 'machine']
          agent_log_level: "info"
          agent_loggers: ['com.appdynamics', 'com', 'com.singularity', 'com.singularity.BusinessTransactions', 'com.singularity.ee.agent.dbagent.collector.server.connection.wmi.NativeClient']

```
