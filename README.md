# AppDynamics Ansible Collection

The AppDynamics Ansible Collection installs and configures AppDynamics agents and configurations. All supported agents are downloaded from the download portal unto the Ansible control node automatically –– this makes it easy to acquire and upgrade agents declaratively. 

Refer to the [role variables](#Role-Variables) below for a description of available deployment options. 

We have built this AppDynamics collection to support (immutable) infrastructure as code deployment methodology; this means that the AppDynamics collection will NOT preserve any manual configurations on the target servers. In other words, the ansible roles will overwrite any local or pre-existing configuration. 
We strongly recommend that you convert any custom agent configuration (this collection does not support) into an ansible role to ensure consistency of deployments and configurations across your estate. 


## Requirements

- Requires Ansible >=2.8.0
- Supports most Debian and RHEL-based Linux distributions, and Windows.
- Windows OS requires >= Powershell 5.0
- Network/firewall access to download AppDynamics agents from `https://download-files.appdynamics.com` and `https://download.appdynamics.com` on the Ansible control node  

<b>Note:</b>  <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"> `jq` </a> is required on the Ansible control node. The collection automatcially  installs `jq` to the control node if it is not installed. 

## Supported Agents

The agent binaries and the installation process for the Machine and DB agent depend on the OS type –– Windows or Linux. This AppDynamics collection abstracts the OS differences so you should only have to provide `agent_type`, without necessarily specifying your OS type.  


|  <img width="200"/> Agent type | Description |
|--|--|
|`sun-java`   or     `java`   | Agent to monitor Java applications running on JRE version 1.7 and less |
|`sun-java8`   or     `java8`   | Agent to monitor Java applications running on JRE version 1.8 and above |
|`ibm-java` | Agent to monitor Java applications running on IBM JRE |
|`dotnet` | Agent to monitor Full .Net Framework application on Windows |
|`machine` | 64 Bit Machine agent ZIP bundle with JRE |
|`db` | Agent to monitor Databases|
|`dotnet-core*` | Agent to Monitor .NetCore applications on Linux|

## Installation

Install the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/appdynamics"> AppDynamics Collection </a> from Ansible Galaxy on your Ansible server:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install appdynamics.agents
```

## Playbooks
Example playbooks for each agent type is provided in the collections's `playbooks` folder.  
You should either reference the example playbooks in the collection installation folder, or access the examples in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-ansible/tree/master/playbooks"> repository </a>. 

The `var/playbooks/controller.yaml` file is meant to contain constant variables such as `enable_ssl`, `controller_port`, etc. You may either use this var or overwrite the variables in the playbooks - whatever works best for you. 

## Java agent

```yml
---
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Include variables for the controller settings
        include_vars: vars/controller.yaml
      - include_role:
          name: appdynamics.agents.java
        vars:
          agent_version: 20.10.0
          agent_type: java8
          application_name: "IoT_API" # ONLY required if agent type is not machine or db
          tier_name: "java_tier" # ONLY required if agent type is not machine or db
          # Directory permissions for agent. These can be set at host level in the invertory as well
          agent_dir_permission:  #defaults to root:root if not specified
            user:  "appdynamics" # This user must pre-exist. It is recommended to use the PID owner of your Java app
            group: "appdynamics" # This group must pre-exist
```

### DotNet agent
In the playbook below, the parameters are initialised directly in the yaml file rather than including them from `var/playbooks/controller.yaml`

```yml
