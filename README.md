# Ansible AppDynamics Collection

The AppDynamics collection installs and configures AppDynamics agents and configurations. Refer to the
[role variables](#Role-Variables) below for a description of available deployment options. It should be noted that
the implementation as provided does not preserve custom configuration settings applied subsequent
to the initial agent installation.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Requires Ansible >=2.8.0
- Supports most Debian and RHEL-based Linux distributions, and Windows.
- Windows OS requires >= Powershell 5.0 for the `Machine agent`, `DotNet agent` and `Java agent`
- Network firewall access to download AppDynamics agents from `https://download-files.appdynamics.com` and `https://download.appdynamics.com` to the Ansible controller.  

Note:  <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"> `jq` </a> is required on the Ansible controller. The AppDynamics collection installs `jq` if it is not installed on the Ansible controller node.

### Installation

Install the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/appdynamics"> AppDynamics Collection </a> from Ansible Galaxy on your Ansible server:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install appdynamics.agents
```

selected in the playbook should be 'machine' or 'db' without the '-win'
suffix, which is added automatically based on the OS family of the host</i>

## Playbooks

### Java agent

For testing purposes you can specify the target controller parameters either directly in the
sample playbooks, or you can include them as shown below from the provided common "controller.yaml" file.

```yml
---
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Include variables for the controller settings
        include_vars: vars/controller.yaml

      - include_role:
          name: appdynamics.agents.java
        vars:
          # Define Agent Type and Version
          agent_version: 20.10.0
          agent_type: java8

          # The applicationName
          application_name: "IoT_API" # ONLY required if agent type is not machine or db
          tier_name: "java_tier" # ONLY required if agent type is not machine or db

          # Directory permissions for agent. These can be set at host level in the invertory as well
          agent_dir_permission:  #defaults to root:root if not specified
            user:  "appdynamics" # This user must pre-exist. It is recommended to use the PID owner of your Java app
            group: "appdynamics" # This group must pre-exist
```

### DotNet agent

In the playbook below, the parameters are initialised directly in the yaml file rather than including them.

```yml
---

        # The applicationName
        application_name: 'IoT_API'
        tier_name: 'login_service2' # ONLY required if agent type is not machine and db agent
